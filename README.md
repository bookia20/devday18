# AWS DevDay Lab: Serverless Data Discovery, ETL and Analytics using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena

In this Lab we are trying to find out how much on average New Yorkers tip their taxi drivers using the [NYC taxi Data Set](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). The data set includes the ride data of the past 8 years for three different cab types in CSV file format. For this lab we focus on Yellow and Green cabs data for the last quarter of 2017.
This lab has been adapted from [AWS Samples Data Analytics](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-data-analytics/blob/master/Lab3/README.md#create-an-amazon-s3-bucket).

## IAM Roles for the Crawler and ETL jobs

Go to the AWS console and in the IAM service page, select Roles in the left pane. There should already exist following two IAM roles:

1- **nycitytaxi-devday18-etlrole**

2- **nycitytaxi-devday18-crawlerrole**

If not, use the this [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/safipour/devday18/blob/master/cf-iam.json) to create the two roles.

You can see the policies associated with each role in the CloudFormation template. For example here is the policies associated with the ETL Role:

![iamroleperm.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/iamroleperm.png)

## Create an Amazon S3 bucket

1. Open the [AWS Management console for Amazon S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2)
2. On the S3 Dashboard, Click on **Create Bucket**. In the **Create Bucket** pop-up page, input a unique **Bucket Name**. It’s advised to choose a large bucket name, with many random characters and numbers (no spaces) to avoid name conflicts. As an example:

   ```
   devday18-<YOURNAME>-syd
   ```
   i. Select the region as **Sydney**.

   ii. Click on **Create**

![bucket.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/bucket.png)

2. Now, in this newly created bucket, create a folder and name it **combined**. Leave the encryption as none (default). We will use these folder to store parquet files result of the ETL process.

## Discover the Data

As mentioned, in this lab we will focus on the data from Q4 2017 of the New York City Taxi dataset, however you could easily do this for the entire eight years of data. To find out what data we have we are going to use AWS Glue Crawler. As we crawl this unknown dataset, you discover that the data is in slightly different format, depending on the type of taxi. You then convert the data to a canonical form, start to analyze it. All without launching a single server.

> For this lab, you choose the **Asia Pacific (Sydney)** region.

CLEAN UP: make sure that you delete database in the Glue Catalog from previous runs of the lab. Go to Athena service page and in a new tab paste:

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS devday18nytaxi CASCADE;
```

Click 'Run Query'. You should see a success message.

1. Open the [AWS Management console for Amazon Glue](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?region=ap-southeast-2#).

2. To analyze all the taxi rides for Q4 2017, you start with the CSV format data that is already uploaded to S3. First, create a database for this lab within AWS Glue. A database is a set of associated table definitions, organized into a logical group. In Glue Catalog, database names are all lowercase, no matter what you type.

   i. Click on **Databases** under Data Catalog column on the left.

   ![glue-database.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/glue-database.png)

   ii. Click on the **Add Database** button.

   iii. Enter the Database name as **devday18nytaxi**. You can skip the description and location fields and click on **Create**.

3. Click on **Crawlers** under Data Catalog column on the left.

   ![glue-crawler.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/glue-crawler.png)

   i. Click on **Add Crawler** button.

   ii. Under Add information about your crawler, for Crawler name type **nytaxi-YOURNAME-csv-crawler**. You can skip the Description and Classifiers field and click on **Next**.

   iii. Under Data Store, choose S3.

   iv. For Include path, enter the following S3 path and click on **Next**.

   ```
   s3://devday18-<YOURNAME>-syd/nytaxi/yellow/
   ```

   v. For Add Another data store, choose **Yes** and click on **Next**.

   vi. Enter path for the Green Taxi data:

   ```
   s3://devday18-<YOURNAME>-syd/nytaxi/green/
   ```

   vii. Select No for another data store and Next.

   viii. For Choose an IAM Role, select **Choose an existing IAM role** and select **nycitytaxi-devday18-crawlerrole** from the drop down. Click on **Next**.

   ix. For Create a schedule for this crawler, choose Frequency as **Run on Demand** and click on **Next**.

   x. Configure the crawler output database and prefix:

   ​	a. For **Database**, select the database created earlier, **devday18nytaxi**.

   ​	b. For **Prefix added to tables (optional)**, type **csv_** and click on **Next**.

   ​	c. Review configuration and click on **Finish** and on the next page, click on **Run it now** in the green box on the top.

   ![runitnow.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/runitnow.png)

   ​	d. The crawler runs (time ~30 sec) and indicates that it found two tables.

4. Click on **Tables**, under Data Catalog on the left column. Hit the circular refresh arrows on the top right side of the page to refresh the page.

5. If you look under **Tables**, you can see the two new tables that were created under the database devday18nytaxi.

   ![glue-csv-tables.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/glue-csv-tables.png)

6. The crawler used the built-in classifiers and identified the tables as CSV, inferred the columns/data types, and collected a set of properties for each table.

7. You can run queries against CSV format data however specially for aggregation type queries (e.g. show me average distance of all rides) since CSV is a row based format cost of running such queries is high and performance is not optimal. Try following query in Amazon Athena and notice the 'Data scanned:' after the query is finished.

   ```
   select count(*) from csv_yellow;
   ```

   i. Open the [AWS Management console for Amazon Athena](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home?force&region=ap-southeast-2).

   > Ensure you are in the **Asia Pacific (Sydney)** region.


   ii. On the left pane for Database select **devday18nytaxi**, copy paste the above SQL statement to the right New query space and "Run query". You should see "28561897" records as a result with following amount of data scanned.

   ![csv-datascanned.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/csv-datascanned.png)


## Transform CSV into Parquet, Combine the tables and Optimize the Queries

Create an ETL job to transform this data into a query-optimized form. We are now going to convert the data into a columnar format, changing the storage type to Parquet, and writing the data to a bucket in your account. We are also combining the Green and Yellow data sets into one and mastering the schema.

1. Open the [AWS Management console for Amazon Glue](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?region=ap-southeast-2).

2. Click on **Jobs** under ETL on the left column and then click on the **Add Job** button.

3. Under Job properties, input name as **<YOURNAME>-nytaxi-combine-etl**.

   i. Under  IAM Role, Choose the IAM role created at the beginning of this lab i.e. **nycitytaxi-devday18-etlrole**.

   x. Under This job runs, choose the radio button for **A proposed script generated by AWS Glue**.

   xi. Leave rest of the items as default and click on Advanced properties. Select **Enable** for Job bookmark. AWS Glue keeps track of data that has already been processed by a previous run of the job if bookmark is enabled.

   xii. Here's a screenshot of a finished job properties window:

   ![glue-job.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/glue-job.png)

4. Click **Next**.

5. Under Choose your data sources, select **csv_yellow** table as the data source and click on **Next**.

6. Under Choose your data targets, select the radio button for **Create tables in your data target**.

   i. For Data store, Choose **Amazon S3**.

   ii. For Format, choose **Parquet**.

   iii. For Target path, **click on the folder icon** and choose the **combined** folder under the bucket that created in step 1. This S3 Bucket/Folder will contain the transformed data in paruqet format.

![glue-etl-target.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/glue-etl-target.png)

7. In map the source columns to target columns page,

   i. Under Target, change the Column name **tpep_pickup_datetime** to **pickup_date**. Click on its respective **data type** field string and change the Column type to **TIMESTAMP** and click on **Update**.

   ii. Under Target, change the Column name **tpep_dropoff_datetime** to **dropoff_date**. Click on its respective **data type** field string and change the Column type to **TIMESTAMP** and click on **Update**.

   iii. Choose **Next**, verify the information and click **Save Job and edit script**.

![glue9](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/reinvent2017content-abd313/lab3/glue_9.PNG)

8. In this step we are going to add a new column indicating the type of Taxi so that we can combine Green and Yellow tables. Because AWS Glue uses Apache Spark behind the scenes, you can easily switch from an AWS Glue DynamicFrame to a Spark DataFrame in the code and do advanced operations within Apache Spark.  Just as easily, you can switch back and continue to use the transforms and tables from the catalog. Make the following custom modifications in PySpark.

> Tip: copy the code in your editor of choice, make the changes and add it back into the console.

  i. Add the following headers:

  ```
  from pyspark.sql.functions import lit
  from awsglue.dynamicframe import DynamicFrame
  ```

  ii. Find the last call before the the line that starts with the datasink. This is the dynamic frame that is being used to write out the data. Let’s now convert that to a DataFrame. Add the following code before this line. Please replace the <DYNAMIC_FRAME_NAME> with the name generated in the script. Add the code before this line.

  ```
  ##----------------------------------
  #convert to a Spark DataFrame...
  yellowDF = <DYNAMIC_FRAME_NAME e.g. dropnullfields3>.toDF()

  #add a new column for "type"
  yellowDF = yellowDF.withColumn("type", lit('yellow'))

  # Convert back to a DynamicFrame for further processing.
  yellowDynamicFrame = DynamicFrame.fromDF(yellowDF, glueContext, "yellowDF_df")
  ##----------------------------------
  ```
  iii. In the last datasink line, change the dynamic frame to point to the new custom dynamic frame created from the Spark DataFrame i.e. yellowDynamicFrame:

  ```
  datasink4 = glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(frame = yellowDynamicFrame, connection_type = "s3", connection_options = {"path": "s3://<YOURBUCKET/ AND PREFIX/>"}, format = "parquet", transformation_ctx = "datasink4")
  ```

9. Next step is to add code for the second data source: Green table. You can achieve this using a separate job but to save time we add additional code to the same job. Right before the 'job.commit()' add following code:

  ```
  ####### Second DataSource

  datasource22 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database = "devday18nytaxi", table_name = "csv_green", transformation_ctx = "datasource22")

  applymapping22 = ApplyMapping.apply(frame = datasource22, mappings = [("vendorid", "long", "vendorid", "long"), ("lpep_pickup_datetime", "string", "pickup_date", "timestamp"), ("lpep_dropoff_datetime", "string", "dropoff_date", "timestamp"), ("store_and_fwd_flag", "string", "store_and_fwd_flag", "string"), ("ratecodeid", "long", "ratecodeid", "long"), ("pulocationid", "long", "pulocationid", "long"), ("dolocationid", "long", "dolocationid", "long"), ("passenger_count", "long", "passenger_count", "long"), ("trip_distance", "double", "trip_distance", "double"), ("fare_amount", "double", "fare_amount", "double"), ("extra", "double", "extra", "double"), ("mta_tax", "double", "mta_tax", "double"), ("tip_amount", "double", "tip_amount", "double"), ("tolls_amount", "double", "tolls_amount", "double"), ("improvement_surcharge", "double", "improvement_surcharge", "double"), ("total_amount", "double", "total_amount", "double"), ("payment_type", "long", "payment_type", "long")], transformation_ctx = "applymapping2")

  resolvechoice22 = ResolveChoice.apply(frame = applymapping22, choice = "make_struct", transformation_ctx = "resolvechoice22")

  dropnullfields22 = DropNullFields.apply(frame = resolvechoice22, transformation_ctx = "dropnullfields22")

  ##----------------------------------
  #convert to a Spark DataFrame...
  greenDF = dropnullfields22.toDF()

  #add a new column for "type"
  greenDF = greenDF.withColumn("type", lit('green'))

  # Convert back to a DynamicFrame for further processing.
  greenDynamicFrame = DynamicFrame.fromDF(greenDF, glueContext, "greenDF_df")
  ##----------------------------------

  datasink22 = glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(frame = greenDynamicFrame, connection_type = "s3", connection_options = {"path": "s3://<YOURBUCKET/ AND PREFIX/>"}, format = "parquet", transformation_ctx = "datasink2")

  ####### End of Second DataSource
  ```

  > Ensure that you replace the bucket name and path with the S3 path you created in step1 (combined folder).

9. The code should look like [Glue Job Code](https://github.com/safipour/devday18/blob/master/glue-etl.py) with the S3 bucket replaced with what was created earlier in both datasink lines. Now click on **Save** and **Run Job**.

11. This job will run for roughly around 4 minutes.

   > While waiting you can inspect the code in the repository to see what steps it takes to transform from CSV to Parquet. Or if you are interested in knowing more about Parquet format you can have a quick read at [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/).

12. To follow the progress you can also view logs on the bottom of the page.

13. The combined folder in your S3 Bucket specified above will now have the converted parquet data.

## Query the Combined Data using Amazon Athena

The Athena query engine uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog to fetch table metadata that instructs it where to read data, how to read it, and other information necessary to process the data. The AWS Glue Data Catalog provides a unified metadata repository across a variety of data sources and data formats, integrating not only with Athena, but with Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, Amazon EMR, and any application compatible with the Apache Hive metastore.

1. Open the [AWS Management console for Amazon Athena](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/athena/query-history/home?region=ap-southeast-2).

   > Ensure you are in the **Asia Pacific (Sydney)** region.

2. Under Database, you should see the database **devday18nytaxi** which was created during the previous section.

3. Click on **Create Table** right below the drop-down for Database and click on **Automatically (AWS Glue Crawler)**.

4. You will now be re-directed to the AWS Glue console to set up a crawler. The crawler connects to your data store and automatically determines its structure to create the metadata for your table. Click on **Continue**.

5. Enter Crawler name as **nytaxi-YOURNAME-parquet-crawler** and Click **Next**.

6. Select Data store as **S3**.

7. Choose Crawl data in **Specified path in your account**.

8. For Include path, click on the folder Icon and choose the **combined** folder previously made which contains the parquet data and click on **Next**.

![glue-crawler-ds.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/glue-crawler-ds.png)

9. In Add another data store, choose **No** and click on **Next**.

10. For Choose an IAM role, select **Create an IAM role**, type **<YOURNAME>-combined-crawler** as the name suffix and click on **Next**.

11. In Create a schedule for this crawler, pick frequency as **Run on demand** and click on **Next**.

12. For Configure the crawler's output, Select **devday18nytaxi** as the database from the drop down. For Prefix added to tables, you can enter a prefix **parquet_** and click **Next**.

13. Review the Crawler Info and click **Finish**. Click on **Run it Now?**.

14. Click on **Tables** on the left, and for database **devday18nytaxi** you should see the table **parquet_combined**. Click on the table name and you will see the MetaData for this converted table.

15. Open the [AWS Management console for Amazon Athena](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home?region=ap-southeast-2#query).

    > Ensure you are in the **Asian Pacific (Sydney)** region.

16. Under Database, you should see the database **devday18nytaxi** which was just created. Select this database and you should see under Tables **parquet_combined**.

17. In the query editor on the right, type

    ```
    select count(*) as recordsNum from parquet_combined;
    ```

    You should see '31268050' records. Also notice the Run Time and Data scanned numbers here. You can see that a lot less data is scanned compare to when you ran the same query against CSV table.

![datascanned.png](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/devday18/nytaxi/images/datascanned.png)

18. Finally: Run the following query to find out the answer to our question:

  ```
  SELECT type,
         cast(avg(trip_distance) as decimal(10,2)) AS avgDist,
         cast(avg(total_amount/trip_distance) as decimal(10,2)) AS avgCostPerMile,
         cast(avg(tip_amount) as decimal(10,2)) AS avgTipAmount,
         cast(max(tip_amount) as decimal(10,2)) AS maxTipAmount,
         count(*) as rides
  FROM parquet_combined
  WHERE trip_distance > 0
          AND total_amount > 0
  GROUP BY  type
  ```

Interestingly you see that on average yellow cab passengers pay more tip and somebody has paid $450 tip. It must have been a happy occasion.

> Note: Athena charges you by the amount of data scanned per query. You can save on costs and get better performance if you partition the data, compress data, or convert it to columnar formats such as Apache Parquet.

## Summary

In the lab, you went from data discovery to analyzing a canonical dataset, without starting and setting up a single server. You started by crawling a dataset you didn’t know anything about and the crawler told you the structure, columns, and counts of records.

From there, you saw the datasets were in different formats, but represented the same thing: NY City Taxi rides. You then converted them into a canonical (or normalized) form that is easily queried through Athena and possible in QuickSight, in addition to a wide number of different tools not covered in this post.
